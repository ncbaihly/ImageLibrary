# Image Compression Service

Overview: You job will be to create a RESTful API service based on Fastapi that manages a database of images.
A supporting UI web application written in NextJS or React should also be created to utilise a section of this API.
The database is represented as a json file and images are stored locally on the file system.

## Requirements
1. Implement a simple CRUD interface for managing the data based on Fastapi.
2. Given a larger image, the API should be able to accept and compress the image and return a downsized version in the http response
3. Implement UI written in NextJS or React to allow the user to select and preview an uncompressed image to be compressed.
4. Implement any other necessary UI components to allow the user to upload an uncompressed image to the API service created in earlier steps.
5. Reusing the components created in earlier steps, display the uncompressed image generated by the API created in earlier steps.
6. Document your project in a readme file

## Bonus
* Package you application into a docker container by defining a dockerfile
